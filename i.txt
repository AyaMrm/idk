PERSISTENCE IDEAS 

File Placement:
    - copy self : copy malware to system directory
    - use current : run from current location
    - multiple copies : redundant copies in different locations

Execution Timing:
    - immediate : Run immediately on startup
    - delayed : Wait random time before executing
    - conditional : Only run under specific conditions
    - staged : Multiple stages with delays

Stealth Techniques:
    - process names : Use legitimate-looking process names
    - file locations : Place in system directories
    - registry names : Use common registry key names
    - execution timing : Avoid immediate execution


DON'T FORGET TO TAKE A SNAPSHOT BEFORE TESTING!
